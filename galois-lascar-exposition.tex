\section{Introduction}

The purspose of this writeup is to construct \(Gal_L(T)\) without
making any arbitrary choices, such as selecting a large saturated
model.

\section{Bounded, Automorphism-Invariant Equivalences}

In this section, I will construct the Lascar equivalence relation in
terms of types.

\begin{definition}
  Let \(T\) be a complete theory.  An \(n\)-ary \defterm{relation
    present in \(T\)} is a subset of \(S_n(T/\emptyset)\).  For any
  \(R\) a relation present in \(T\), \(a_1,\ldots,a_n\) in an
  appropriate context, say that \(R(a_1,\ldots,a_n)\) holds just if
  \(\tp(a_1,\ldots,a_n) \in R\).
\end{definition}

This definition corresponds to the usual definition of an
automorphism-invariant relation.

\begin{proposition}
  Let \(\mathcal{U}\) be a sufficiently large model.  An \(n\)-ary
  relation \(R\) on this model is automorphism-invariant iff it arises
  as a relation present in \(T\).
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
  Let \(R\) be a relation present in \(T\), \(f \in
  Aut(\mathcal{U})\), and \(a\in \mathcal{U}^n\).  Since \(f\) is an
  automorphism, \(\tp(a) = \tp(f(a))\).  Therefore \(R(a)\) iff
  \(R(f(a))\), so \(R\) is automorphism-invariant.

  Let \(R\) be an automorphism-invariant relation on
  \(\mathcal{U}^n\), and let \(a,b \in \mathcal{U}^n\) have the same
  type.  Since \(\mathcal{U}\) is sufficiently homogeneous, there is
  an automorphism \(f\) with \(f(a) = b\).  Since \(R\) is
  automorphism-invariant, \(R\) agrees on \(a\) and \(b\).  Therefore
  whether \(R\) holds of a tuple depends only on the tuple's type, so
  \(R\) arises as a type present in \(T\).
\end{proof}

We can define reflexivity, symmetry, and transitivity of a binary
relation present in \(T\) without referencing any models.

\begin{definition}
  Let \(R(x,y)\) be a binary relation present in \(T\).  \(R\) is
  \defterm{reflexive} if \([x = y] \subseteq R\), where \([x = y]\) is
  the filter generated by the given formula, viewed as a (closed) set
  of types.
\end{definition}

\begin{proposition}
  Let \(R(x,y)\) be a binary relation present in \(T\).  \(R\) is
  reflexive iff it yields a reflexive relation in all models, iff it
  yields a reflexive relation in a sufficiently large model.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
  Let \(R(x,y)\) be a reflexive relation present in \(T\), \(M \models
  T\), and \(a \in M\).  Since \(\tp(a,a) \in [x = y] \subseteq R\),
  \(R(a,a)\).  Therefore \(R\) yields a reflexive relation in all models.

  Let \(R(x,y)\) be a relation present in \(T\) which is not
  reflexive.  Let \(\mathcal{U} \models T\) be sufficiently large.
  Since \(R\) is not reflexive, take \(p(x,y) \in [x = y]\) with \(p
  \notin R\).  Since \(\mathcal{U}\) is sufficiently saturated, take
  \(a,b \in \mathcal{U}\) with \(\mathcal{U} \models p(a,b)\).  Since
  \(p \in [x = y]\), \(a = b\).  However, since \(p \notin R\), \(\neg
  R(a,b)\).  Therefore \(R\) does not yield a reflexive relation in
  \(\mathcal{U}\).
\end{proof}

\begin{definition}
  Let \(R(x,y)\) be a binary relation present in \(T\).  \(R\) is
  \defterm{symmetric} if, for all \(p(x,y) \in R\), \(p(y,x) \in R\).
\end{definition}

\begin{proposition}
  Let \(R(x,y)\) be a binary relation present in \(T\).  \(R\) is
  symmetric iff it yields a symmetric relation in all models, iff it
  yields a symmetric relation in a sufficiently large model.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
  Let \(R(x,y)\) be a symmetric relation present in \(T\), \(M \models
  T\), and \(a,b \in M\) with \(R(a,b)\).  Set \(p(x,y) = \tp(a,b)\).
  Since \(\tp(b,a) = p(y,x) \in R\), \(R(b,a)\).  Therefore \(R\)
  yields a symmetric relation in \(M\).

  Let \(R(x,y)\) be a binary relation present in \(T\) which is not
  symmetric.  Let \(\mathcal{U}\) be a sufficiently large model.
  Since \(R\) is not symmetric, take \(p(x,y) \in R\) with \(p(y,x)
  \notin R\).  Since \(\mathcal{U}\) is sufficiently saturated, take
  \(a,b \in \mathcal{U}\) with \(\tp(a,b) = p(x,y)\), so \(R(a,b)\).
  However, \(\tp(b,a) = p(y,x) \notin R\), so \(\neg R(b,a)\).
  Therefore \(R\) does not yield a symmetric relation in
  \(\mathcal{U}\).
\end{proof}

\begin{definition}
  Let \(R(x,y)\) be a binary relation present in \(T\).  \(R\) is
  \defterm{transitive} if, for all \(p(x,y), q(x,y) \in R\),
  \([p(x,z), q(z,y)]\restriction_{x,y} \subseteq R\), where \([p(x,z),
    q(z,y)]\restriction_{x,y}\) is the filter in \(x,y\) obtained by
  restricting the filter in \(x,y,z\) generated by the formulas in
  \(p(x,z)\) and \(q(z,y)\) to those formulas only mentioning \(x\)
  and \(y\).
\end{definition}

\begin{proposition}
  Let \(R(x,y)\) be a binary relation present in \(T\).  \(R\) is
  transitive iff it yields a transitive relation in all models, iff it
  yields a transitive relation in a sufficiently large model.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
  Let \(R(x,y)\) be a transitive relation present in \(T\), \(M
  \models T\), \(a,b,c \in M\) with \(R(a,b)\) and \(R(b,c)\).  Set
  \(p(x,y) = \tp(a,b)\) and \(q(x,y) = \tp(b,c)\).  We know that \(p,q
  \in R\).  Furthermore, \(r(x,z,y) := \tp(a,b,c) \in [p(x,z),
    q(z,y)]\), so \(\tp(a,c) = r\restriction_{x,y} \in R\), and
  therefore \(R(a,c)\).  Therefore \(R\) yields a transitive relation
  in \(M\).

  Let \(R(x,y)\) be a binary relation present in \(T\) which is not
  transitive.  Let \(\mathcal{U}\) be a sufficiently large model.
  Since \(R\) is not transitive, take \(p(x,y), q(x,y) \in R\),
  \(r(x,z,y) \in [p(x,z), q(z,y)]\), with \(r\restriction_{x,y} \notin
  R\).  Since \(\mathcal{U}\) is sufficiently saturated, take \(a,b,c
  \in \mathcal{U}\) with \(\tp(a,b,c) = r\).  This implies that
  \(\tp(a,b) = p\) and \(\tp(b,c) = q\), so \(R(a,b)\) and \(R(b,c)\).
  However, since \(\tp(a,c) = r\restriction_{x,y}\), \(\tp(a,c) \notin
  R\) and \(\neg R(a,c)\).  Therefore \(R\) does not yield a
  transitive relation in \(\mathcal{U}\).
\end{proof}

For an equivalence relation present in \(T\), there is a purely
combinatorial definition of boundedness.  We want to say that an
equivalence relation is bounded if there aren't too many equivalence
classes.  Since an equivalence relation present in \(T\) is just a set
of types over the empty set, the ways in which elements can be in
different equivalence classes correspond to those types \emph{not} in
the relation.  By Ramsey theory, if there are too many inequivalent
elements, there are infinitely many elements inequivalent by the same
type.  By compactness, it is therefore possible to have arbitrarily
many elements inequivalent by this type.  This characterization is
formalized below.

\begin{definition}
  Let \(p(x,y) \in S_2(T)\).  Then \(\sym(p)\), the \defterm{symmetric
    closure} of \(p\), is \(\{p(x,y), p(y,x)\}\).  Since \(\sym(p)
  \subseteq S_2(T)\), \(\sym(p)\) is a (symmetric) relation present in
  \(T\).  Additionally, since \(\sym(p)\) is a finite set of points,
  it is closed, and therefore corresponds to a filter of formulas.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
  Let \(p(x,y) \in S_2(T)\).  \(\sym(p)\) is \defterm{graph-infinite}
  if \([\sym(p)(x_i,x_j), x_i \neq x_j : i \neq j]\), a filter in the
  variables \(\{x_i\}_{i \in \omega}\), is consistent.
\end{definition}

\begin{proposition}
  Let \(p(x,y) \in S_2(T)\).  Then the following are equivalent:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item \(\sym(p)\) is graph-infinite;
  \item for some infinite \(\kappa\), there is a model with \(\kappa\)
    many elements pairwise related by \(\sym(p)\);
  \item for all infinite \(\kappa\), there is a model with \(\kappa\)
    many elements pairwise related by \(\sym(p)\); and
  \item for any \(\kappa\)-saturated model \(\mathcal{U}\), there are
    at least \(\kappa\) many elements of \(\mathcal{U}\) pairwise
    related by \(\sym(p)\).
  \end{itemize}
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
  This is an easy consequence of compactness.
\end{proof}
