\section{Introduction}

The purspose of this writeup is to construct \(Gal_L(T)\) without
making any arbitrary choices, such as selecting a large saturated
model.

\section{Bounded, Automorphism-Invariant Equivalences}

In this section, I will construct the Lascar equivalence relation in
terms of types.

\begin{definition}
  Let \(T\) be a complete theory.  An \(n\)-ary \defterm{relation
    present in \(T\)} is a subset of \(S_n(T/\emptyset)\).  For any
  \(R\) a relation present in \(T\), \(a_1,\ldots,a_n\) in an
  appropriate context, say that \(R(a_1,\ldots,a_n)\) holds just if
  \(\tp(a_1,\ldots,a_n) \in R\).
\end{definition}

This definition corresponds to the usual definition of an
automorphism-invariant relation.

\begin{proposition}
  Let \(\mathcal{U}\) be a sufficiently large model.  An \(n\)-ary
  relation \(R\) on this model is automorphism-invariant iff it arises
  as a relation present in \(T\).
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
  Let \(R\) be a relation present in \(T\), \(f \in
  Aut(\mathcal{U})\), and \(a\in \mathcal{U}^n\).  Since \(f\) is an
  automorphism, \(\tp(a) = \tp(f(a))\).  Therefore \(R(a)\) iff
  \(R(f(a))\), so \(R\) is automorphism-invariant.

  Let \(R\) be an automorphism-invariant relation on
  \(\mathcal{U}^n\), and let \(a,b \in \mathcal{U}^n\) have the same
  type.  Since \(\mathcal{U}\) is sufficiently homogeneous, there is
  an automorphism \(f\) with \(f(a) = b\).  Since \(R\) is
  automorphism-invariant, \(R\) agrees on \(a\) and \(b\).  Therefore
  whether \(R\) holds of a tuple depends only on the tuple's type, so
  \(R\) arises as a type present in \(T\).
\end{proof}
